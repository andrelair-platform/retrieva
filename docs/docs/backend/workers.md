# Background Workers

The platform uses [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) backed by Redis for background job processing.

## Active Workers

| Worker | Queue | Concurrency | Purpose |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `assessmentWorker.js` | `assessmentJobs` | 2 | Orchestrate file indexing + DORA gap analysis |
| `questionnaireWorker.js` | `questionnaireJobs` | configured by `QUESTIONNAIRE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | LLM scoring for vendor questionnaire responses |
| `monitoringWorker.js` | `monitoringJobs` | 1 | Run compliance monitoring alert checks every 24 h |

All workers are started automatically when the backend process starts (imported by `backend/index.js`).

## Assessment Worker (`workers/assessmentWorker.js`)

Handles two job types on the `assessmentJobs` queue:

### `fileIndex` job

Triggered when a user uploads a file for an assessment.

1. Parses the file buffer (PDF, DOCX, XLSX) via `fileIngestionService`
2. Splits text into semantic chunks
3. Embeds each chunk via Ollama (`bge-m3`, 1024-dim)
4. Upserts chunk vectors to Qdrant collection (`assessment_{id}`)
5. Updates `Assessment.documents[].status` → `indexed` | `failed`

### `gapAnalysis` job

Triggered once all files for an assessment have been indexed.

1. Polls (up to 2 minutes) until all `fileIndex` jobs complete
2. For each DORA article, retrieves relevant chunks from Qdrant
3. Calls the LLM (via the AI gateway / LiteLLM) to classify coverage: `covered` | `partial` | `missing`
4. Stores gap results in `Assessment.results`
5. Updates Assessment status: `analyzing` → `complete` | `failed`

### DORA Knowledge Base

Before running assessments in a new environment, seed the compliance knowledge base:

```bash
npm run seed:compliance         # Upsert DORA articles into compliance_kb collection
npm run seed:compliance:reset   # Wipe and re-seed
```

The seed script is idempotent.

## Monitoring Worker (`workers/monitoringWorker.js`)

Runs compliance monitoring checks on a 24-hour schedule. Triggered by a BullMQ repeatable job set up at server startup via `scheduleMonitoringJob()`.

### Job type: `run-monitoring-alerts`

Calls `runMonitoringAlerts()` from `alertMonitorService.js`, which runs 4 checks in parallel:

| Check | Condition | Alert key |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Certification expiry | `validUntil` within 90 days | `cert-expiry-90-<certType>` |
| Certification expiry | `validUntil` within 30 days | `cert-expiry-30-<certType>` |
| Certification expiry | `validUntil` within 7 days | `cert-expiry-7-<certType>` |
| Contract renewal | `contractEnd` within 60 days | `contract-renewal-60` |
| Annual review overdue | `nextReviewDate` is in the past | `annual-review-overdue` |
| Assessment overdue | No complete assessment in 12 months | `assessment-overdue-12mo` |

### Deduplication

Alert state is persisted in `Workspace.alertsSentAt` (a `Map<String, Date>`). Each check skips sending if the alert key was already sent within the last 20 hours. This gives the daily cron 4 hours of drift tolerance.

### Email delivery

Alerts are sent to all **active owners** of the workspace via `emailService.sendMonitoringAlert()`, subject to the owner's `notificationPreferences.email.system_alert` setting.

### Configuration

```bash
MONITORING_INTERVAL_HOURS=24   # How often the job runs (default: 24)
```

## Queue Configuration (`config/queue.js`)

Four queues are defined, with two using scheduled repeatable jobs:

```javascript
export const assessmentQueue    = new Queue('assessmentJobs',    { ... }); // assessmentWorker
export const questionnaireQueue = new Queue('questionnaireJobs', { ... }); // questionnaireWorker
export const monitoringQueue    = new Queue('monitoringJobs',    { ... }); // monitoringWorker (scheduled)
export const memoryDecayQueue   = new Queue('memoryDecay',       { ... }); // scheduled repeatable job
```

All queues use exponential backoff and Redis for persistence.

- `scheduleMonitoringJob()` — registers the 24-hour compliance alert repeatable job on startup
- `scheduleMemoryDecayJob()` — registers the 24-hour memory decay repeatable job on startup

## Graceful Shutdown

`workers/index.js` handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`:

1. `closeQueues()` — stops accepting new jobs, waits for active jobs
2. `disconnectRedis()` — closes Redis connections
3. `closePg()` — closes the PostgreSQL connection pool

## Running Workers

Workers start automatically when the backend process starts (imported by `backend/index.js`).

```bash
# Start backend + workers together
npm run dev
```
